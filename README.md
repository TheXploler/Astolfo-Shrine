It's my astolfo shrine, because why not

## Are you obsessed with Astolfo?
### No
<sub>It's not because I like Astolfo, okay? 😒 I just think that it's an interesting character with a unique design and personality, that's why I put him there. It's not like I'm attracted to them or anything. 😳 I mean, sure, he's cute and adorable, but that doesn't mean I want to date them or cuddle with them. 😏 I'm just a normal guy who likes normal girls. 😇 And besides, Astolfo is not even a real person, he's just a fictional character from an anime. 😅 So there's no reason for me to like him <sup>~~or femboys in general~~</sup>. I'm just curious about him, that's all. Nothing more, nothing less. 😐</sub>
